        <h2>Project 1: Website Design (Spring 2024)</h2>
        <a href="nareza-travel/index.html">Visit My Project</a>
        <p>I learned to make our own personal website related to things that we like; which I chose Travel to be my topic.<br>
        I made 4 pages:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Home Page</li>
            <li>5 Countries for Every Continents</li>
            <li>7 Wonders of the World</li>
            <li>YouTube Creators Sharing Information About Destinations Around the World</li>
        </ul> </p>

        <h2>Project 2: Web Foundations (Spring 2023)</h2>
        <p>I gained a solid understanding of the core concepts behind web page structure and development. I explored the fundamental 
            building blocks of HTML documents, including the use of tags, elements, and attributes. The course also covered essential best practices 
            for creating accessible, well-structured webpages, ensuring content is correctly rendered accross different browsers.
        </p>
        <h2>Project 3: Microcomputers (Spring 2024)</h2>
        <p>In this project, I utilized the PIC24 microcontroller with MPLAB IDE to design an embedded  system 
            that controls on LED control and interacts with a switch input functionality. 
            The system involves programming the microcontroller to control LED based on user input through
            a tactile switch, utilizing low-level assembly language for precise hardware manipulation.</p>
        <p>This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in configuring microcontroller I/O pins, implementing
            pull-up resistors, and managing input/output interactions, enhancing my skills in embedded systems programmming
            and hardware interfacing.
        </p>
        <h2>Project 4: Software Design and Engineering (Fall 2024)</h2>
        <p>As part of my coursework, I worked on developing and enhancing the Chocoholics Anonymous (ChocAn) system, 
            a software solution for managing membership and service records for a fictional support group.
            The system's primary objective was to automate the tracking and reporting of participant activities, enabling efficient
            management of resources and operations.
        </p>
        <p>I focused on implementing and optimizing key functionalities of the system, including:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Database Management: </strong>Designed and implemented SQl-based system for managing member information, 
                service records, and group statistics. I ensured data integrity, performed normalization to reduce redundancy, and optimized 
                queries for faster retrieval.</li>
                <li><strong>User Interface Design: </strong>Developed a user-friendly interface for members and administrators,
                    allowing for easy navigation, real-time updates, and interaction with the system. This involved designing interactive screens 
                    for members to log activities and view reports.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Performance Optimization</strong> Focused on optimizing the performance of critical database operations, such as 
                searching and sorting large datasets. I implemented efficient algorithms to improve the system's response time and ensure scalability as the 
                system grows.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Project 5: Data Structures and Algorithms (Fall 2024)</h2>
        <p>I gained a deep understanding of the fundamental building blocks of computer science, focusing on the efficient organization, manipulation, and analysis 
            of data. The course covered both theoretical concepts and hands-on coding practice, preparing me to solve complex computational problems and optimize solutions 
            for performance.
