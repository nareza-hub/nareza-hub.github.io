        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Neoma Reza, a third-year student majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and minoring in <strong>Computing Technology and Applications</strong> at the <strong>University of Alabama</strong></p>
        <p>My passion for technology and problem-solving led me to pursue a career in software development.
        In my journey so far, I have gained hands-on experiences working with a variety of programming languages,
        including <strong>C, C++, Python, Assembly, SQL, and Java.</strong> My coursework and personal projects have allowed me to explore
        the fascinating world of machine learning, web development, operating systems, microcomputer, and data analysis.<br>
        I've developed an appreciation for both the technical and creative aspects of building efficient, user-centered applications.</p>
        <p>Alongside my academic pursuits, I enjoy learning about new technologies and improving my coding skills through practical projects.
        When I'm not coding, you can find me designing website, exploring different software architectures, or having conversations with others 
        to learn other people's experiences and/or life journey to inspire me.</p>
        <p>I am always excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new opportunities that challenge my skills and expand my knowledge.</p>
        <p>Outside of tech, I have a deep love for food and enjoy relaxing with friends or family over coffee, boba, or even ice cream, especially by the riverside.
        Whether it's catching up with them or simply taking in the view, I cherish the little moments that make life memorable.</p>
